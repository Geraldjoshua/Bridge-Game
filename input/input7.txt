CLAIM
11
opponents have 5 trumps and you have lots of top cards in other suits which might be trumped by the opposition.
you only have 2 losers in your hand, one S and one D, so can ruff the D in dummy.
there is no danger suit.
there is no danger hand.
you do not know anything from the bidding.
You have many winners so you need to draw trumps to avoid these winners being trumped, but don't draw the last trump because it is the highest.
END
