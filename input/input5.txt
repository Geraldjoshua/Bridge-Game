CLAIM
10
dummy has D and C losers, you have H and C losers.
you can avoid losers in each hand by ruffing them in partner's hand because you have all the top trumps except AS, and you will need to cross-ruff because each hand has losers and these are in different suits.
there is no danger suit.
there is no danger hand.
you do not know anything from the bidding.
You have to cross-ruff, so must play your other suit winners first, so they aren't trumped later. When you ruff you must ruff with a high card, not the 4, otherwise the opposition may play a higher trump.
END
