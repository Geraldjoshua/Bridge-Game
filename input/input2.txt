CLAIM
10
losing C and D tricks.
you can ruff D losers in dummy.
there is no danger suit.
there is no danger hand.
you do not know anything from the bidding.
Plan to ruff your low D cards in the dummy; You must do this before you play any trump tricks, else you won't have any S in dummy to ruff your losers with; And you must be able to get to your hand to play those D cards, so keep the C winners in your hand for this purpose; thus play the AH and then another H so you can ruff it in your hand and play the AD and KD and then ruff the 3rd D in dummy; repeat this by reaching your hand with AK and ruffing your last D in diamond before playing all the remaining trumps.
END
