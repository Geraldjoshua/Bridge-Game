CLAIM
7
you could lose control of trumps.
you can ruff S in dummy; you can finesse in H and S; you can establish in S.
there is no danger suit.
there is no danger hand.
you do not know anything from the bidding.
Plan to finesse in S twice, and then ruff a 3rd S in dummy, and hopefully you will then also have established your last two S as winners - this will mean you have no losers in S & as you also have no losers in C you hope to limit losers in H and D to just 3 losers. On the first trick, finesse the JD, hoping W had the QD; On the 2nd trick, play KH or QH - can't afford to play TH (in case W wins with JH and then plays AH and then a 3rd H, making it impossible for you to later ruff a S in dummy); On the 3rd trick, do not take the C finesse as it will not help you, win with the AC; Now put your S plan into action, and after ruffing the 3rd round of S in dummy, finesse upto the TH; When that finesse loses and W plays the QD, you must play the KD because if it doesn't win now it never will; Once the KD wins the rest of the tricks are yours!
